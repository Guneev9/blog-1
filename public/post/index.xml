      <description>Since 1973 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have conducted the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), which is intended to gather information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men’s and women’s health. The survey results are used to plan health services and health education programs, and to do statistical studies of families, fertility, and health.&amp;quot; See http://cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm. We will use data collected by this survey to investigate whether first babies tend to come late, and other questions.</description>
